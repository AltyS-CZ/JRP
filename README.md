# Jax's Custom Framework

This framework is built from scratch. Although it is not finished, I will accept any and all suggestions if they are possible. I intend to include tons of features such as jobs and inventory and shops. I'm trying to code this all with AI using Chat GPT4 and so far it works great! This will be the first fivem framework created with Chat AI!




HOW TO INSTALL:
Upload sql to database
Make sure your database name is fivem_economy

Write `ensure custom_framework` in server.cfg
Restart Server

SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE IN MY DISCORD SERVER.

DISCLAIMER:
Please Note: This framework is built with Chat GPT4 AI and will continue working with AI for future updates.
